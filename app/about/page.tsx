              I'm currently a final year student at Amrita University, Coimbatore.
              I also try to freelance in my free-time
              <br />
              <br />
              My skills span across web and app development, system engineering,
              web scraping, UI/UX and social-network analytics. I love solving problems.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I have experience being on both sides of the table, as a developer and as a coordinator. 
              I co-founded a community initiative in my university called iDEA that improved the 
              quality of projects developed by students and revived a good coding culture within the university.
              <br/>
              <br/>
              I was a Tech lead/Cloud facilitator at my university's GDSC chapter. 
              I co-organised several workshops during my tenure.
